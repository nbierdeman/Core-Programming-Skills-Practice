# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# puts "Please enter your first name:"
# first_name = gets.chomp

# puts "Please enter your last name:"
# last_name = gets.chomp

# puts "Your full name is " + first_name + " " + last_name + "."

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# puts "Please enter your first name:"
# first_name = gets.chomp

# puts "Please enter your last name:"
# last_name = gets.chomp

# puts "Your full name is #{first_name} #{last_name}."

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp.downcase

# case word
# when "marco"
#   puts "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# colors = []
# 3.times do
#   puts "Please enter a color:"
#   color = gets.chomp
#   colors << color
# end
# puts "The three colors you chose are " + colors[0] + ", " + colors[1] + ", " + colors[2] + "."

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# colors = []
# 3.times do
#   puts "Please enter a color:"
#   color = gets.chomp
#   colors << color
# end

# puts "The colors you chose are #{colors[0]}, #{colors[1]}, and #{colors[2]}."

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# puts "Please enter a name:"
# name = gets.chomp.capitalize

# if name != "Santa"
#   puts "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# puts "Please enter the title of a book:"
# title = gets.chomp
# puts "Please enter the author of that book:"
# author = gets.chomp

# puts "The title of the book is " + title + ", " + "and the author is " + author + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# puts "Please enter the title of a book:"
# title = gets.chomp
# puts "Please enter the author of that book:"
# author = gets.chomp

# puts "The title of the book is #{title}, and the author is #{author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# puts "Please enter your password:"
# pw = gets.chomp

# if pw == "Joshua"
#   puts "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   puts "Access denied"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# cities = []

# 3.times do
#   puts "Please enter the name of a city:"
#   city = gets.chomp
#   cities << city
# end

# puts "You chose " + cities[0] + ", " + cities[1] + ", and " + cities[2] + "."
