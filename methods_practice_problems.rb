# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp.upcase
# puts word

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# if number > 100
#   puts "That's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# numbers = []

# 2.times do
#   puts "Please enter a number:"
#   number = gets.chomp.to_i
#   numbers << number
# end

# puts numbers[0] + numbers[1]

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts number * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# words = []

# 2.times do
#   puts "Please enter a word:"
#   word = gets.chomp
#   words << word
# end

# puts words[0].upcase + " " + words[1].upcase

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp

# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# if number < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# numbers = []

# 2.times do
#   puts "Please enter a number:"
#   number = gets.chomp.to_i
#   numbers << number
# end

# puts numbers[0] * numbers[1]

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp

# if word.length > 5
#   puts "That's a long word"
